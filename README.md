# Small API for ripping prices from Google Spreadsheet
This was originaly made for [POLITIME's donate page](https://ptime.infy.uk/donate.html), yet, you can use this however you see fit.

This *requires* Google Service Account, and for that account to have access to the targeted Spreadsheet. (Be it, public or not.)

With ❤️ from Ukraine
